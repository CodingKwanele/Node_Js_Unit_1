Learn why this is important<https://aka.ms/LearnAboutSenderIdentification>\nThis email originated from outside of the organisation: Be cautious about the sender, attachments and links. If uncertain use Report Message button.\nHi Nesan\n\nLong time since we last communicated.\n\nI hope that this email finds you well. Here in Mossel Bay things are going very well.\n\nI would like to call on you to use your Vodacom contacts, if possible, to resolve my Airtime issue. Herewith a summary of what the issue is.\n\nI have 2 Vodacom contracts.\n\n  1.  082 997 2499 - this is a SIM only contract on which I buy airtime occasionally. I use this to make all my phone calls.\n  2.  071 492 8367 - this is a data sim for my LTE Wi-Fi.\n\nOn Friday, 7 February 2025, I bought R300 Airtime using the VodaPay app on my 082 997 2499 cell phone device. Unfortunately, I was in a hurry and selected the 071 492 8367 LTE Wi-Fi sim. This resulted in that I now have R401 Airtime on my LTE Wi-Fi sim that I am unable to use to make voice calls.\n\nI tried the following to transfer the Airtime from 071 492 8367 to 082 997 2499.\n\n  1.  On 9 February 2025 I used the VodaPay app on my 082 997 2499 cell phone device to transfer the R401 Airtime to my 071 492 8367 LTE Wi-Fi. This required me to approve the transfer via an otp send with a sms to  071 492 8367 LTE Wi-Fi sim (this sim unfortunately is in my router and are unable to receive a sms).\n  2.  On 10 February 2025 I went to the Vodashop in Heiderand in Mossel Bay. A very friendly employee indicated that he will be able help me, but that he will need my LTE Router. I drove all the way back home (about 10km) to fetch the router. He tried for about 20 minutes to transfer the Airtime. He even put the LTE sim in a cell phone device but still could not transfer the airtime. Reason, the sim cannot receive a sms.\n  3.  I then went home and called 082 135 at 13:16. I requested the Call Centre Agent to transfer the Airtime. He informed me that he is not allowed to do it, but he will open my sim on 071 492 8367 so that it could receive a sms. He informed me that he can only do it halfway and that I will then need to supply a Message Centre Code. All this is far to complicated for me. I gave up.\n  4.  On Friday, 14 February 2025 at 13:42, I gathered enough energy and called 082 135 again. I was assisted by a Call Centre agent by the name of Anita, (I think). I have explained all the attempts made thus far to transfer the Airtime. She also informed he that she is not allowed to do so. I then requested her to provide me with an escalation contact number whereby she then offered to transfer my call to her manager. After holding on for about one minute, she informed me that her manager will call me back within 30 minutes. Up to now, no call from the Manager.\n\nAll the people I have spoken to was very friendly. Unfortunately, my issue is still not resolved. This should be a very simple issue to resolve as both the contacts are registered in my mame. Also, the functionality to transfer Airtime is available, but is not working without an otp approval (I can understand that this is a security issue), although the VodaPay app should then have a check that prevent someone to purchase Airtime if the sim one purchase it for cannot receive a sms.\n\nIt is not that I am desperately needing the R401 Airtime, but I am only concerned how many clients is lost to Vodacom, as a result of unsolved queries like this.\n\nKind Regards\nNico\n082 997 2499\n\n\n\n\nC2 General\n\n\nC2 General\n\n\nC2 General\n\n\nC2 General"
